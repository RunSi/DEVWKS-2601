## The Lab


The files within this Github repository should be cloned to the local machine.

The objective of this lab is to:

* Become familiar with connecting to a testbed
* Leverage to the Genie Ops libraries for retrieving operational data
* Explore the models and parsers leveraged by Genie Ops
* To become familiar with the Genie Parsergen library
* To start the journey on creating your own simple libraries

## Pre-requisites

Users of this lab should have some familiarity with Python and basic concepts of 
object oriented programming.

The CSR1000v IOSXE Boxes must be available on your system.  
Instructions for creating the CSR1000v Boxes can be found at:-  [Box Building](https://github.com/hpreston/vagrant_net_prog/tree/master/box_building)  
Vagrant VM Boxes must be named - _iosxe/16.08.01a_ - Alternatively modify [Vagrantfile](/lab_build/Vagrantfile) to point to your local CSR1000v box
